# SL2_Patch_Builder
A work-in-progress patch builder/customizer for the Boss SL-2 Slicer effect pedal.

## What works
- Skeleton functionality for reading a `.tsl` live set file, converting to Python objects, and writing back to `.tsl`.

## What's in progress (in order of most-to-least priority)
- Verify that a `.tsl` file written from program can be read correctly by the SL-2
- Complete the Jupyter notebook to demonstrate reading/modifying/writing a patch.
- Create visualizations/simple GUI to help in designing patches (i.e. drag parameters up/down)
- Generate a packaged GUI application or web dashboard that allows users to generate and modify their own patches.
